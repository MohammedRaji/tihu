# Tihu, Persian Text-To-Speech

[Tihu](https://github.com/tihu-nlp/tihu) is an open source Persian text-to-speech engine. It's a cross-platform application and  written in C++. 

##build requirements
Before compiling tihu you need to be sure you have following packages:
### libsamplerate/libsndfile
libsamplerate is required for resampling wave output.

If you are compliling tihu on Windows, I have compiled version 0.1.8 ([here](https://github.com/tihu-nlp/tihu/tree/master/src/third_party/libsamplerate/x86)) and libsndfile version 1.0.26 ([here](https://github.com/tihu-nlp/tihu/tree/master/src/third_party/libsndfile/x86)).

### Qt
for running tihu_console you need to install Qt framework. Find latest Qt framework and Qt Creator [here](https://www.qt.io/).

##Compiling
To compile tihu on linux operation system run 'make' on tihu folder.
Windows users can compile tihu by visual studio.
